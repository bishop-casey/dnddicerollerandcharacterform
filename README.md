## Simple RPG Character Generator with dice roller. Made with Windows Forms using C# with Visual Studios.
## It is recommended to try running with Visual Studio or VS Code and will most likely work only on windows computers due to the format it is in.
##### Plaese look at file called Simple RPG that is the only working file. Several Error accurred with previous projects that lead to fatal unknown errors.
##### This gereator is unfinieshed but stable exept for saving the characters settings an unknown error accurs that I did not have time to track down. If you know or have an idea
##### about the error feel free to let me know.
##### 
##### The current working sections of the code for the project include Inheritance from a parent class Creature and two child classes NPC and Player. The children inhereate 
##### several functions and data from the parent.
##### 
##### There are a couple of master loops in the character creation form telling the player to create a name for the character, what gender they are and what class they will be
##### the loop will not let them move on until they have completed the section or closed the app so as to ensure proper character creation.
##### 
##### The loops also display the playes charactera stats in a message box when they have completed the creation process. This was also intended to save the stats in to a xml file
##### one the players computer so they could see and use the character. The save and load requirement ran into and issue I could not fix in time for the deadline. I deeply      
##### regret that becasue it would have been very intersting and fun to play around with.
#####
##### It was a pleasure being tuaght by everyone and a great experiance. Thank you for your time and help.
