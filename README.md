### Simple RPG v2
 PLease use file Simple RPG v2. This is a windows form with C# as the language and was created with Visaul Studio.
 Please use a windows pc due to the formating and Visual Studio or VS Code to run the application.

 This is a simple app that lets someone create a character for an RPG game. The app can save the characters name, gender and class then diisplay it later.
 This app also contains a Simple random dice roller for when it is needed.

##### Requirements to Meet
##### -Master Loop - There is a Master Loop set up for the character creator form that informs the player that they must fill out all section of the creator. If this is not done a message box will appear and tell the player what they need to fill out then returning them to that creator. There are also the buttons that are used to navagate the app. 
##### -Read and Write to an external file - The apps save button creates a file on the users desktop with the data they entered on the character creation form. This data is saved in RPGCharacter folder on the decktop in an XML format. The app can also read from this file and show it to the player in the character info form.
### -Inheritance - There is one parent class the Creature class and two children classes from which they inherit from Creature. The children classes are the player and NPC classes which get the constructor and properties from creature.
##### - display user input information - the player will enter in information of the character creation form and when they press the save button a meaagse box will appear with the information they have entered before the file is saves.

###### Flaws: The app is very simple and does not show a lot of information. The code is very sloppy and can be improved on as my skill improves. Can be modified for better use and have an actual game that could be played with the character at a later date.
